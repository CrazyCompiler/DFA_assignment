QUESTION :

Write the following program in Java.

A DFA generator will accept a 5 tuple that consists of a
 - set of states, an alphabet set, a transition function, an initial state and a set of final states.
It will return a DFA which in turn can determine whether a string is in that language or not.

Please ensure that the 5 tuple can be specified as a JSON object in a file. The transition function can be written as a transition table:

ex:

q1,1,q1
q1,0,q2
...
...


Input :

 - 5 tuple - set of states, an alphabet set, a transition function, an initial state and a set of final states



Output :

 - aaa - accepted

 classes :

  - States
  - Alphabets
  - transitions
